<p>github-profile works!</p>

<!-- 
    Just to check if angular destroys the GithubProfileComponent.
    In this scenario, we've 2 different routes for the same GithubProfileComopnent. 
        1. /followers/:userid
        2. /followers/1234
        
    So, in this case it doesnt make sense for an angular to destroy the comoponent if we've 2 different
    navigations for the same component. 

    If we have a scenario where we want user to stay on the same page and navigate back and forth then 
    we must use observable for the multiple routes on the same component.

<button [routerLink]="['/followers', 1234]" class="btn btn-primary">Next</button>
<button (click)="submit()" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
